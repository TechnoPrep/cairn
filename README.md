# project-1-ne-tj-eb - Cairn

## Description
This application was inspired by the want to explore the US and all of its National Parks for camps, fishing, or simply just to visit and explore the history. The name Cairn was chosen as it means a man-made pile of stones. Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present. In modern times, cairns are often erected as landmarks, a use they have had since ancient times. We wanted the user to be able to view National Parks by state and be provided the current weather for exploration, and also, give them the ability to favorite Parks they want to visit in the future, to create their own Cairn.

## How To Use

The user is presented with a page and a form to select from all US States and Territories to then be provided with a page that contains all the National Parks within that state, an image, a brief description, hours of operation, and current weather at that national park. They also have the ability to click on the "Heart" button for each park to save that park to a favorites list. All favorite parks will keep a red heart and then be stored for ease of viewing on the Favorite Page.
